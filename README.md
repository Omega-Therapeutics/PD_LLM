# Efficient Protein-DNA Binding Prediction Using Large Language Models
The GitHub repository dedicated to the research on “Efficient Protein-DNA Binding Prediction Using Large Language Models”, as outlined in the previously discussed abstract, serves as a comprehensive digital resource for scientists and researchers in the field. This repository hosts implementation details and examples of the innovative approach using large language models (LLMs) for extracting embeddings from protein sequences. For those keen on replicating or building upon the research, detailed documentation guides users through the utilization of Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM)-v2, ProteinBERT (PB), and the AlphaFold2 embeddings. Additionally, the repository contains pre-trained models, especially the graph attention networks that achieved an AUC of around 90%, thus offering a ready-to-use solution for those aiming to study Protein-DNA interactions.
